The Odin Project's "Rock, Paper, Scissors" 

The basic version (console-version.js) plays the game on console only, with a bunch of fun(ny) alerts. 
The main file (index.html, linked to js and css) is the advanced version with UI : https://hiredshinobe.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/

I still have to figure out how to reset the page and start a fresh round of game. 13.01.21

The Odin Project's "Rock, Paper, Scissors" seems easy at first but it was quite a challenging experience for me. In the end, I am pleased with how it turned out and so excited to understand the logic behind it and go through trial and error to figure out how it works. 
 This simple version shows the results using a whimsical alert, with more details on the console. I plan to return and add front-end to it when I learn how to do it. 14.12.20
 The time has come! Let's add a simple but fun UI to the game. 10.01.21
